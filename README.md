Uptown Minneapolis neighborhood map.

Learning MVVM (Knockout.js), I created a neighborhood map of Uptown Minneapolis using Four Square API and Google maps API.

If you want to run it on your local machine. Download and unzip all files to a local directory, and then open the index.html with your favorite browser that runs JavaScript.
